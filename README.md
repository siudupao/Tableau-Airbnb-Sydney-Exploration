# Tableau-Airbnb-Sydney-Exploration

Project Overview
--
Airbnb is a popular online marketplace for people to rent out their properties or spare rooms to travelers. The platform offers various types of accommodations such as shared rooms, apartments and houses. 

Our hypothetical client has announced that they would like to enter the Airbnb market in Sydney. They would like to invest in some properties as listings, however they have no knowledge of the current market, which types of properties to invest in and where. My goal is to provide the client with an overview of the current Airbnb market in 2023 and the potential rates that they can expect to be charging nightly. 

Dataset
--
The dataset used for this project is from "[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)". The dataset contains summary information and metrics for listings in Sydney for the first quarter of 2023. The dataset is in csv format and is also attached in this repo.

Exploration Questions
--
1. How many listings are there currently on the market and which room type has the highest number of listings?
2. How does the price of an Airbnb rental vary by property type (entire home/apartment, private room, shared room) in Sydney?
3. What is the distribution of Airbnb rental prices for entire homes/apartments in Sydney, and what is the average nightly price?
4. What are the top 5 neighborhoods in Sydney with the highest number of listings?
5. What are the top 5 neighborhoods in Sydney with the highest average Airbnb rental prices?

Tableau Visualisation

To view the Tableau visualisations in Tableau Public, click [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/siu.du.pao/viz/AirbnbSydneyVisualisation/Story1). Insights were noted on each story.

Recommendations and Insights
-- 
Our hypothetical client should invest in entire homes/apartments in the neighborhoods of Pittwater, Mosman, Woollahara, Manly and Warringah. Entire homes/apartments have greater capacity to charge for higher prices. The listed 5 neighborhoods are the top 5 neighborhoods charging the highest average nightly prices. 
These insights are based solely on maximizing nightly rates.

Further Exploration
--
Further exploration can be done by identifying which characteristcs make a popular listing/most in demand from the guest perspective, with respect to the number of bedrooms, beds, and baths and even amenities. 
Which neighborhoods have the highest occupancy rates throughout the year? 
Exploring seasonal effects on listing prices, occupancy rates, etc..
